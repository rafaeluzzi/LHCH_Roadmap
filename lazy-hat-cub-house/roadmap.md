# ðŸš€ Roadmap

Here are the core proposals and ideas that we as a group will be developing. These are dynamic and are set just as a first stone. We want your input and ideas to further evolve our roadmap and add new targets to it.

* Creation of a private Twitter Group
* Creation of a gated Discord
* Registering our ENS and setting our Gnosis Safe multi-sig wallet
* **Lazy Pool -** Creation of a gated [investment Club/DAO](lazy-pool-investment-club-dao.md) limited to 100 members to be in compliance with [SEC investment clubs](https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsinvclubhtm.html) requirements.&#x20;
* **Lazy Pool GF -** First private group funding round for our multi-year [investment Club/DAO](lazy-pool-investment-club-dao.md) in true web3 fashion, where as a group we will aim to own bluechip assets like otherside deeds and others. Future funding rounds and the assets to be purchased will be decided by [proposals and voting](lazy-pool-investment-club-dao.md#how-to-join-and-how-is-the-lazy-pool-governed) by the group.
* **Collabs -** Establish collaboration and partnerships with other like-minded Lazy Lions subgroups that share our passion for building our brands and IPs.
* **Lazy Merch** - Having the coolest trait with the most marketing potential doesn't mean anything without access to high quality merch and street wear related to our trait group brand that we can flex IRL.
* **Lazy Shore -** Metaverse Club House - Our own little paradise beach club house where we can host virtual events and unlock new economic and ownership opportunities. Access to our club house will be expanded to our subgroup partners tru access tokens or other means decided by our community.
* **Airdrops/Rewards** - Maximize [**Lazy Pool**](lazy-pool-investment-club-dao.md) gains through future airdrops, rewards and external collaborations. Example of this could be the creation of a utility non-monetary token, metaverse wearables, etc.&#x20;
* &#x20;**Software Utilities/Tools**&#x20;
* **Events & Parties** (IRL) (Future)
