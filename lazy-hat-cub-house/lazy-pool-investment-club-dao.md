# ðŸ’¸ Lazy Pool Investment Club/DAO

### [What, Why, and How Lazy Pool?](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] <a href="#what-is-lazy-pool" id="what-is-lazy-pool"></a>

Lazy Pool is a gated investment Club/DAO limited to 100 members of the [Lazy Hat Cub House](../) to be in compliance with [SEC investment clubs](https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsinvclubhtm.html) requirements. We are starting this as a way to pool our funds, so we can collectively invest to gain market share and exposure to bluechip assets like for example Moonbirds, Azuki, Otherside, and/or other valuable assets and of course more assets in the Lazy Lions ecosystem. This will allow affordable exposure to those projects and for us to maximize gains by participating in future airdrops and the benefits that those projects provide. The lazy pool will also help increase the value of Lazy hat cubs through promotion and contribution. By using [Prysm](https://nftsquads.gitbook.io/resource-center/faqs/general-faqs) to power our investment club it will facilitate Venture Capital-like funding rounds, voting infrastructure, ownership tracking, and members management.&#x20;

## How to join and How is the Lazy Pool governed?

The first step to becoming a member is owning at least one delisted [Lazy Hat Cub](https://opensea.io/collection/lazy-cubs-?search\[sortBy]=UNIT\_PRICE\&search\[sortAscending]=true\&search\[stringTraits]\[0]\[name]=Headgear\&search\[stringTraits]\[0]\[values]\[0]=LAZY%20Hat) (Requirements are subject to change) and asking to be added to our private Twitter group.

You will then need to participate in our first funding round (Opening/Closing date TBA) by depositing (range of ETH TBA) to our Lazy Pool Prysm Deposit Page (link TBA).

Membership stakes are automatically calculated by Prysm and displayed on our project page for transparency.

We will use a trait-gated discord for â€‹[Proposals and voting](broken-reference) where each member will have an equal vote regardless of their stake.

Proposals will have 48 hours voting periods and at least 50% of the membership must participate in the vote least 50% of the membership is in favor of a proposal to be successfully passed and executed.

## Exiting the Lazy Pool?

A member can [propose](lazy-pool-investment-club-dao.md#how-do-i-enter-the-dead-pool) for a vote the liquidation and the distribution of proceeds for any or all Lazy Pool-acquired assets at any time.

For a single member to liquidate their stake and exit the Lazy Pool, a [member's proposal/approval](lazy-pool-investment-club-dao.md#how-do-i-enter-the-dead-pool) and the availability of funds in the Lazy Pool treasury will be required.

## When and How many funding rounds?

Our first funding round opening/closing dates and asset targets are TBA soon. Any subsequent funding rounds will be established by a [member's vote](lazy-pool-investment-club-dao.md#how-to-join-and-how-is-the-lazy-pool-governed). When a new funding round proposal is passed the percentage of ownership for new members will be determined based on the current Lazy Pool valuation (Net asset value of holdings plus a premium to reward first-rounders risk).&#x20;

## &#x20;Prysm management and Lazy Pool wallet

All Lazy Pool assets will be stored in a Gnosis Safe multi-sig wallet. This wallet is the Lazy Pool treasury and it is managed through the Prysm dashboard. &#x20;

There will be 5 signers on Prysm controlling the Lazy Pool multi-sig wallet with the required threshold of 3 out of 5 signers for an approved [member proposal ](lazy-pool-investment-club-dao.md#how-to-join-and-how-is-the-lazy-pool-governed)to be executed.

Current signers are:

## Lazy Pool investment horizon and risks?

Lazy Pool is to be considered a long-term investment. As a core strategy, we could seek some assets to be held for a long period of time but if those assets yield future airdrops, then those could be sold more frequently with proceeds distributed to members.&#x20;

It's important to know that like any NFT investment there are risks. Lazy Hat Cub House members and members of the Lazy Pool make no guarantees and are not liable for any loss of profit or funds due to participation in the Lazy Pool.
